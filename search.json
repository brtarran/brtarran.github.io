    "text": "I’m Brian Tarran. Fatso Jetson is a desert rock band from California, USA, but I started using the name as my Xbox Gamertag years ago and I’ve clearly grown overly attached to it.\nBy day, I am a writer and editor with 20 years’ experience covering the research and data space. I have worked for the Royal Statistical Society (RSS) for the past 8 years, and was editor of Significance Magazine (a joint publication of the RSS, the American Statistical Association and the Statistical Society of Australia) prior to the launch of Real World Data Science, a new data science site published by the RSS.\nI am a former editor of Research-Live.com and was launch editor of Impact magazine, both published by the Market Research Society.\nIn my spare time, I play as many games and watch as much film and TV as grown-up responsibilities allow. I plan to use this site mostly to keep track of the things I’m playing, watching and reading, and to share what I think about them. I’m also learning how to code, so this is my space to experiment without the worry of breaking anything important!\nIgnore this - this is a test.\n\nThis site is open source. {% github_edit_link “Improve this page” %}"
